# Airbnb Data Exploration

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.7 (likely any version 3.* is acceptable).
Results of the projects from the Udacity Data Scientist course.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I used the Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. Are there bad locations for Airbnb listings?
2. What is the average price of an Airbnb listing per neighborhood?
3. What quantitative features affect Airbnb price?

The data used is in listings.csv, and can also be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

## File Descriptions

The Airbnb_Exploration Jupyter Notebook available here shows the exploratory data analysis pertaining to the questions in the project motivation.

The data is contained in listings.csv as noted above.

## Results 

The main findings of the code can be found at the post [here](https://medium.com/@ajkrause27/title-13be2185879f)
Quick summary: 
1) Plots showing the location of the worst rated listings (Ravenna neighborhood being the worst).  
2) Plots showing that location of the highest average weekly price listings (Central Seattle being the highest). 
3) Features that affect price the most relate to location and size have the biggest impact, while ratings have little impact.
